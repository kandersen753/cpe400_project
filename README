Installation instructions
======================================================

You do NOT need to install any extra files or libraries
other than standard g++ dependencies. Please ensure that
g++ is installed and updated before continuing. 

Before running the simulation, you must compile the source
code. After unzipping the folder, you may compile by typing:

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
   make
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
into the terminal. 

You may now run the program by following the instructions
in the "Program running instructions" section of this 
README.

Note: you may remove object files and the executable by typing:
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
make clean
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Program Background
======================================================

This program desmonstrates Project Number 4, which is 
Dynamic routing mechanism design in faulty network.

(1)When running this program a file will be read in to create
the world the packets will be sent through.

(2)From there, each node will perform a DSR optimal path search
and will store the optimal path as well as suboptimal paths returned
to it for future use.

(3)Each node created will have a random value ranging 
from 0-80 percent of the node failing for DEMONSTRATION 
purposes on how the system will react to nodes going on/off.

(4)Based on if an neighboring node is on or off, the current node
with the packet will anaylze and send the information accordingly
to follow an greedy optimal path.



======================================================
Program running instructions
======================================================

./project 0 7 paths.txt 1

where:

	0 - The starting node the packets will be sent from
	7 - The end node that the packets will be untimately sent to
	paths.txt - The structure of the world that the packets will be sent through
	1 - The boolean flag (0 or 1) for incremental packet sending by keyboard command


-----------------
paths.txt OUTLINE
-----------------
Each line in the file will have data that will be used to create the world
that the packets will be sent through. EACH line will have three integer values. 
An axmple line can look like this:

	0 1 2

	0 - The node start that will have this connection 
	1 - The node end node that will complete this connection
	2 - The weight of this connection between the two nodes

!IMPORTANT! There are only 9 nodes allowed in this program for
demonstration purposes. These node names range from 0-8 for both
start and end node. The start and end node may not be the same.
